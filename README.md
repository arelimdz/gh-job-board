# mx51 API Greenhouse Job Board

## Project description:

This project was commenced as a Hackathon Project for the Coder Academy FEB-23-STD cohort. The original Hackathon code has been refactored and adjusted and is now owned by [mx51 Pty Ltd.](https://mx51.com/).

It is a single-page web application created using the "create-react-app" framework. The application serves as a custom API-driven job board for mx51, utilizing Greenhouse's open APIs. It primarily handles GET requests, with the "Apply" link for each job directing users to Greenhouse-hosted pages, ensuring secure POST requests.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this front-end-only application is to provide an interactive and modern job board for [mx51](https://mx51.com/), offering users the ability to filter job listings based on location, department, or a combination of both. The project aimed to enhance the user experience and bring a contemporary approach to job listings, aligning with the company's efforts to update their website from plain HTML and CSS to a more dynamic and interactive platform.
